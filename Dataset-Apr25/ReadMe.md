# CSV Files:
1. image_paths.csv - contains the image paths of each chunk
2. results.csv - contains the chunks information
3. text_csv_file.csv - contains texts corresponding to chunks



# All the image paths in the image_paths.csv file should be changed slightly
The last part of the path "keyframes_images/j4oNAvbo6yg/frames_003.jpg" remains the same. The directory has to be changed as shown below -   
* Original path: /home/easgrad/baluhars/1234567890/Video_Dataset/SUNDAY_TEST/keyframes_images/j4oNAvbo6yg/frames_003.jpg
* Changed path: ...your directory.../keyframes_images/j4oNAvbo6yg/frames_003.jpg
