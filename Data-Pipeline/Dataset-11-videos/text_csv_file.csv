 This technique is suitable for epididymal obstructive azoospermia and vasectomy without

 Thank you.
 A patient selection with preoperative imaging to delineate anatomy and tumor involvement
 to determine the adequate pre-surgical treatment which must be initiated.
 The considerations of this approach include the finding of inadequate retrograde flow
 through the gastroduodenal artery, which must prompt either the need for arterial reconstruction
 or aborting the procedure.
 The stomach must also be carefully monitored for ischemic changes during division of major arterial and venous structures.
 However, the remnant gastroepiploic vessel
 epiploic vessels are often sufficient to maintain perfusion. If at any time the dissection does not
 feel safe or feasible, converting to a traditional open surgical approach must be considered.
 The use of the robotic platform for complex pancreatic resections has increased as surgeon
 experience grows and the technology becomes more accessible. Our institution has experience with
 utilizing the robotic platform for both pancreatic oduodenectomy and distal pancreatectomy
 however our approach is only one of many. In conclusion we believe that with proper
 preoperative planning, patient selection, and surgeon experience our approach for robot
 assisted distal pancreatectomy with celiac axis resection is safe and feasible for the
 management of locally advanced pancreatic tumors of the body and tail of the pancreas."
