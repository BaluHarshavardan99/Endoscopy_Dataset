Vzn77Lnibqs,0,"particular and at the end there will be a full length video so that you can see
 exactly what I see when I do the procedure. Let's get started.
 I'm going to show the anatomy so that you understand what we're doing when we do an
 upper GI tract endoscopy. Essentially we look at the upper airway, the esophagus, the stomach,
 and the first part of the duodenum. The endoscopy is often called by other names such as a gastroscopy
 although that's less specific because gastro indicates stomach and we're scoping more than
 just the stomach. In England it's often called an OGD. The O is for esophagus with the English
 spelling, G for gastro, and D for duodenum so esophagogastroduodenoscopy which is quite a
 mouthful. The procedure itself is very similar to the endoscopy. The endoscopy itself is very
 similar to the endoscopy itself. One needs to prepare for nothing to eat in terms of solid food
 for eight hours prior to the procedure. You can have clear fluids up to two to three hours before
 the procedure. Majority of my patients have it done with some sedation but it can be done with
 just simply local spray to the upper airway. Approximately 30 to 50 percent of my patients
 have it done that way. Next I want to show the anatomy. I'm going to rotate the mannequin here
 because we start at the teeth and the lips. The scope is advanced over the top of the tongue. This
 is the tongue here and it's angled downwards to go to the back of the throat. Now the esophagus
 is a posterior structure meaning it's towards the back and this is the entrance way where my finger
 is to go in there. You will see there's a yellow structure here a little flap that's called the
 epiglottis. This is the epiglottis. This is the epiglottis. This is the epiglottis. This is the
 epiglottis. That epiglottis or flap will fold down and cover the vocal cords which is just below it
 so that when you swallow food the food doesn't go down the wrong way. The food will be guided
 into the esophagus."
Vzn77Lnibqs,1,"and cover the vocal cords which is just below it so that when you swallow food
 the food doesn't go down the wrong way. The food will be guided into the
 esophagus. Now I want to show you where the esophagus is once we pass this
 section and to do that I have to get rid of some of the organs and the reason is
 is it's a posterior structure so I'm going to remove the lungs and then I'm
 going to remove the heart. Now you can see posteriorly this brown structure it
 looks like a tube and it's the esophagus. It starts at about 20 centimeters from
 the lips and it goes all the way down to the bottom part where it joins the
 stomach right here at 40 centimeters again a distance from the lips. The
 esophagus is circular and it's like a tube and it
 treats the esophagus like a tube and it treats the esophagus like a tube and it
 treats the esophagus like a tube and it treats the esophagus like a tube and it
 transports the food down. You will see on the video that I'm about to show some
 peristaltic waves which are waves of contraction. This is a muscular organ
 that contracts to squeeze to push the food down into the stomach. Now at the end
 of the esophagus in this light blue color going from one edge of the body all
 the way to the center and then again across here is the diaphragm. It's a big
 muscular structure and it will
 have a hole in it that the esophagus right here goes through and that's
 called the diaphragmatic hiatus. Now I'm going to remove the liver. The liver is
 in brown here so that you can see the stomach. This is the stomach. I'm going to
 remove it here for a minute so you can see it. The junction between the stomach
 and esophagus is right here at the diaphragm and you will see on the video
 that the lining looks different and that's because they're different cells
 that line the stomach compared to the esophagus.
 The stomach is an organ which secretes acid to help digest and break
 down the food into smaller components so that it can leave the stomach through
 the end of the stomach which is called where there's an opening called the
 pylorus and the food will then go down there into this section which is the
 small intestine. The first bit of the small intestine has a special name it's
 called the duodenum. Now you'll notice that the stomach has a particular
 shape to it. Part of the stomach sits up high here. This part is called the fundus
 and it's hard to see that part with the scope. The scope has a camera on the end
 that looks forward so when you're looking forward and the scope is here
 you're not going to see this section and so when we do the scope when you see the
 video you will see that I perform a maneuver which we call retroflexing the
 scope where we bend it on itself and basically get turn it into a jade
 so the scope comes down and then it twists like a big hook and looks back
 upon itself so that we can see this section in here because this is poorly
 seen if we just put the scope down forward viewing. Now the small intestine
 here this is the beginning and it turns to go down further into the abdomen and
 this is the entire small intestine here which ultimately joins with the large
 intestine which is in blue.
 The small intestine is this pinkish color and the large
 intestine which is also known as a colon is actually in blue and the colon starts
 here and there'll be a separate video on my colonoscopy that will go over the
 anatomy and there will be nice video on a colonoscopy so you can see what that's
 like if you're having one done. But the colon there's a section called the
 ascending colon. This section is called the transverse colon because it goes
 across the colon.

 and the descending colon ultimately turns into the sigmoid colon then the
 rectum and then the bowel contents come out through the anus"

 the food to be absorbed. Often they're easiest to see when there's some liquid on top and that's

 This is an endoscopic view of the right side of the nose

 The septum is midline with a large spur, or deflection.
 On the lateral wall of the nasal cavity are the inferior middle turbinates.
 Nasal obstruction in this case is primarily caused by the septal spur

 over now. That is not enough. There is a large area here that you'll see in a moment that has
 a whole lot of mucosa underneath what we can see now. So this is quite a fair way away from being
 finished. And so what we end up doing now is we use a drill and we'll remove that bit of bone.
 Make sure the irrigation is working. There it's going now. And then we'll take this bone off. Now
 doing this anterior limit here first is very important because if you don't remove this,
 you can't really get your shaft into the rest of the sinus cavity. So we do the bit anterior first.
 Just means that the rest of our shaft, as we advance,
 our drill will actually be able to move into the sinus cavity without lifting up because an anterior
 lip of bone is pushing the shaft of the drill up. So start anteriorly and then move backwards.
 Obviously, the descending palatine nerve and artery are close here. As long as you can see a
 straight ridge there, you can take it and you don't have to go right up to it. You can go close

 you know, into the nasal wall itself, we'll often just free it up and just get rid of it

 from the floor and just obliterate the floor if it's very very deep but in this case I think it's
 going to work very well but look how far across towards the midline the maxillary sinus actually

 the dura and the fat with small pieces of sergicil. The sergicil itself forms a nice coagulum

 incision. We use endocut eye. Okay. One more cut. So now, one more. Okay. So now we have
 a very good incision. And then we can easily get in a submucosal space. Okay, okay. Knee
 down. Okay. It's okay. And then, so, just in front of us, we can see a surface of the
 muscle layer. So using the splay coagulation. So first step is to recognize the circular
 muscle. Okay. Now we are dissecting very closely to the circular muscle.
 Okay. And then come close. Okay. We can recognize the fibers of the muscle. So that, that is
 a lining transversely. And then we continue dissection. This is really a circular muscle.
 Okay. Okay. Like this. So at the time we were creating submucosal tunnel, we are sticking
 to the surface of the muscle. And then advance the endoscope. Injection, please.
 So one of the worries sometimes in the tunnel is to get lost. Especially when we are having
 a very dilated esophagus. Do you have any tricks?
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it's very simple. So watch the lining of the muscle. And then,
 so we approach any time transversely. Transversely.
 I see. I see.
 So I always mention this as crossing the zebra line. Crossing the road by the, following
 the zebra line.

 a little bit, okay, now it's okay.
 So conical cap is a little bit smaller
 than the other one."
msNEFdmhQMI,6,"you can see this is the entry, mucosa entry. This minor bleeding is from the
 mucosa cut end, but no problem. Okay, anyway, so this is a submucosal space. We
 will continue to dissect the submucosal fibers. Anyway, go straight. Now I'm
 inserting the TT knife. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Okay. So using
 splay coagulation we can easily dissect the submucosal fibers like this. So
 coagulation onto the muscle fiber is a good sign because we are
 dissecting very
 close to muscle and then go straight like this okay always under visual
 control okay so how do I know that the recently you change a little bit of the
 approach of the technique to a posterior side we can accept both so anterior
 myotomy posterior myotomy we can accept both but generally so for non-expert hand
 so I generally recommend the posterior myotomy because when we approach
 posteriorly so we don't encounter any large vessel even even when we get in a
 stomach anterior so particularly when we approach a two o'clock direction
 yes
 that is a connecting to the arrestor curve of the stomach we may encounter
 sometimes not not always sometimes we may encounter large vessel yes so
 generally speaking for young doctor now we lose a blue dye so repeat the
 injection"
msNEFdmhQMI,7,"You can recognize this is a circular, this is circular, and then continue coagulation.
 Okay, now you can see something different at the bottom of the dissected area.
 This is the surface of the longitudinal muscle layer.
 Now we catch the circular muscle using the one angulation of the triangle tip knife.
 And then one coagulate and cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut.
 Okay, once again.
 Back up the endoscopy a little bit.
 Okay, so split a little bit.
 And then this is the border of the circular muscle.
 We catch some circular muscle.
 You can recognize the circular muscle.
 And then into a muscular space,
 they are linked.
 There is some vein.
 So it's better to one-shot coagulation.
 And then after that, cutting current.
 Muscle layer itself, no bleeding.
 Okay, put the triangle plate onto the intramuscular space.
 So gradually advance endoscope.
 Catch some circular fiber, muscle fiber.
 The muscle layer is not so much thick.
 Okay.
 Like this.
 Then we can dissect the circular muscle.
 Okay, catch circular.
 Okay.
 Now I use a cutting current.
 Okay, like this.
 And then this is an intramuscular space.
 Behind there is a longitudinal muscle.
 I coagulate a little bit.
 This is longitudinal muscle fibers.
 You can see much better.
 Can you see?
 Yes, very clearly.
 So this is a longitudinal muscle fiber.
 But it's not necessary to expose.
 Anyway, put the plate into a muscular space.
 And then advance endoscope.
 Catch some circular muscle.
 And then using cutting current, we can dissect it.
 I think we will have to break for lecture.
 We are slightly behind time.

 The size is almost
 I don't know
 one, two, three centimeters
 or more, maybe.
 And the lesion is covered with
 mucus.
 So at this moment, I
 think this lesion might be
 a cis-isolated polyp,
 adenoma or polyp."
3_4b086YEdY,5,"So, at this moment, I think this lesion might be a

 I agree, it has the typical features of"

 cesal serrated lesion.
 Dr. Yes.
 And if we use NBI, we can see the surface structure in detail.
 Unfortunately, the surface of the lesion is covered with
 whitish substance.
 Probably, I think this is a so-called WOS, white opaque substance, and this is developed
 by, named by Kenshi Yao.
 Kenshi Yao is still not here, but this"

 Kenshi Yao is still not here, but this sign is suggesting that"

 And sometimes SSAP has such finding"

 difficult to see the crypt opening if we can observe the brownish dots or
 dilated brownish dots it means open dilated crypt opening then we will have
 more confidence for that this region might be a SSAP"

 for showing the technique or to show our technique.
 Dr. Toguchi, I've noticed that you have a string,
 which perhaps the audience can see at the lower end of the cap.
 Do you mind telling us about the string, please?"
3_4b086YEdY,17,"I noticed that you have a string which perhaps the audience can see at the lower end of the

 Do you mind telling us about the string, please?
 The endoscopic image, you can see a string.
 Before insertion, I inserted the string into the endoscopic channel, and I inserted totally
 into the colonoscope, and I pulled it up from the tip of the colonoscope.
 And now the other end of the string is coming from her anus, and we tied the end, both ends.
 So now the string is making a loop.
 A giant closed loop.
 And so I will use this for traction later.
 Yes."
3_4b086YEdY,18,"A string is making a loop.
 A giant closed loop.

 Yes.
 Anyway, at first we need to inject some substance,
 hyaluronic acid."
3_4b086YEdY,19,"Anyway, at first we need to inject some substance, hyaluronic acid.
 So when do you decide or how do you decide when to perform ESD versus traditional piecemeal EMR?
 Yes, of course, it's a very important point."
3_4b086YEdY,20,"you decide or how do you decide when to perform ESD versus traditional piecemeal EMR?
 Yes, of course, it's a very important point.
 If the lesion is suspicious for invasive cancer, we remove the lesion unblocked, definitely.
 So of course, it depends on the size also.
 If the lesion size is larger than two centimeter and if the lesion is suspicious for cancer,
 we should do ESD for the lesion.
 And this lesion is just a"
3_4b086YEdY,21,"if the region size is larger than two centimeter
 and if the region is suspicious for cancer,
 we should do ESD for the region.
 And this region is just a sessile-threaded adenoma polyp"
3_4b086YEdY,22,"And even in Japan, we are discussing about the indication
 for such SSAP."
3_4b086YEdY,23,"Even in Japan, we are discussing about the indication for such SSAP, but I think even
 for the SSAP, such large region, when we do piecemeal email, then the risk for polyp residue
 will be much higher.
 So hopefully, we do unblock resection.
 I think that's a good point.
 There was a recent study from the group at Dartmouth Medical Center in the United States
 that showed that the risk of incomplete resection was actually highest with sessile serrated
 lesions.
 In fact, sessile serrated lesions had a 30% rate in that study of incomplete resection."
3_4b086YEdY,24,"highest with cesalcerated lesions. In fact, cesalcerated lesions had a 30 percent rate
 in that study of incomplete resection.
 I see.
 So I think I agree with you. We need to have a better technique for removal
 of these lesions. As you said, I don't think we know yet if
 ESD or just a wide-field EMR is the optimal method. But clearly, we've not done a"
3_4b086YEdY,25,"As you said, I don't think we know yet if ESD or just a wide-field EMR is the optimal method.
 But clearly, we've not done a very good job getting complete removal of such lesions in the past.
 Yeah, yeah.
 And so, Dr. Wallace, so question for you.
 So if you need to take on a lesion like this, like very flat, for example, like 0-2A type of lesion,
 do you have any special recommendation for the snare if you decide to do an EMR?
 When you do EMR, we do use special snares that are stiffer than your normal snare.
 It's important for all flat lesions to use a very stiff snare.
 Fortunately, all of the major companies now make stiff snares."
3_4b086YEdY,26,"It's important for all flat lesions to use a very stiff snare.
 Fortunately, all of the major companies now make stiff snares.
 I think each endoscopist has their own preference for a snare.
 But the key is that it's very stiff, which allows you to push down into the saline cushion and get a very stiff snare."
3_4b086YEdY,27,"I think each endoscopist has their own preference for a snare, but the key is that it's very stiff,
 which allows you to push down into the saline cushion and get the snare underneath the lesion.
 But I think ESD, I think you'll be able to, with very skilled hands,
 the outcomes of ESD are clearly better in terms of local recurrence rate.
 The major disadvantage of ESD is that it takes longer to do.
 There's a slightly higher perforation rate, although all of those perforations can be closed with clips.
 It's extremely rare that perforation requires surgery.
 Exactly. What do you think about the underwater EMR?
 Ken Binnmuller, now in San Francisco, has described this underwater technique.
 I think it's a useful technique in certain circumstances.
 The principle is that..."
3_4b086YEdY,28,"San Francisco has described this underwater technique.
 I think it's a useful technique in certain circumstances.
 The principle is that the polypoid, even the flat tissue, will essentially float in the water
 and become more separated from the muscle layer so that you don't need to do an injection.
 So it has the advantage that you eliminate the injection step.
 In my view, I don't use it so much because I find that even a small amount of bleeding
 causes the whole field to become red when you're underwater."
3_4b086YEdY,29,"So I don't use it so much, except in specific cases, for example, a flat lesion inside a diverticulum or a flat lesion covering the appendiceal orifice.
 For me, it helps float them out into the lumen.
 Yeah, yeah."
3_4b086YEdY,30,"lesion inside a diverticulum or a flat lesion covering the appendiceal orifice for me it helps
 float them out into the lumen yeah actually we we are very interested in underwater technique
 and when we do underwater eml we use nbi during underwater email then we can observe the
 clear merging of the lesion"
3_4b086YEdY,31,"And when we do underwater EMR, we use NBI,
 during underwater EMR, then we can observe
 the clear margin of the region.
 Hmm.
 Yeah, water itself provides"
3_4b086YEdY,32,magnification yes yes yes so i i agree it gives you a very nice view and anyway uh today i will do esd
3_4b086YEdY,33,"So I agree.
 It gives you a very nice view.

videoVKfe1cBHwZo,0,"and my neurosurgical partner, Dr. Van Gumpel.
 As you can see on this coronal T1 post-contrast MRI scan,
 there's a large cystic supracellar mass
 with a face of the thalamus
 and extension high into the third ventricle.
 Here we are in the left nasal cavity
 getting our initial access,
 out fracturing the inferior and middle turbinates

 There is a bit of a leftward septal deviation
 reducing our access a bit here on the left side.
 Here's the left sphenoid os
 which we'll go ahead and open with a kerosene rongeur.
 Then we'll go ahead and do the right side of the nose.
 In order to facilitate access in our transplenum approach,
 we are resecting the middle turbinate as you can see here.

 We'll raise that from the front to back and then go ahead and grab it and place it into

 deviated bone and cartilage to gain that access once that access is gained here we are creating

 That was a bit of a right-sided anody cell bringing continuity. Then we're selecting
 the very back of the nasal septum here to get access to the anterior portion of the
 planum. Then once again, we're removing that last bit of the keel of the rostrum to maximize
 our angles here as you work into the common sphenoid cavity. At this juncture, we'll go
 ahead and remove the entirety of the mucosa of the sphenoid sinus. We know that we're"

 this with a nasal septal flap. So it's important to remove all of the mucosa in order to allow the
 septal flap to adhere well to the bone, as well as to reduce the risk of getting a mucus seal in the
 long term. Now we're just drilling down some of the inner sinus septations, and then finally the
 planum and the tuberculum, as you can see here, removing the bone in order to access the dura
 just below it. Once that bone has been thinned down to an eggshell consistency, we're removing
 this with a caulk."

 Once that bone has been thinned down to an HL consistency,
 we're then removing this with a caudal elevator
 and kerosene rongeur, exposing the dura here,
 you're beginning to see the optic nerves and chiasm
 just behind the dura there as well.
 Here we are utilizing ultrasound to visualize
 the area behind here, the cystic mass,
 as well as making sure there's not any prominent vessels
 just behind us there.
 And then here we are beginning to open up the dura
 in this window between the optic chiasm above us
 and the pituitary gland just below us.
 In this case, the pituitary stock has been pushed
 to the left by the tumor.
 So open up here close to the midline,
 then bipolar in the edges of the dura
 to reduce bleeding during the dissection.
 Here we are incising dura just at the inferior aspect
 of the optic chiasm.
 And then we'll use a very nice feather blade here next
 to incise that dura safely while pulling it away
 from the optic nerves and chiasm,
 but we are incising the dura
 from the underline of the tumor itself.
 Now you're beginning to see some very nice,
 meticulous microsurgical technique to dissect the dura free
 from the underlying tumor, that cystic mass,
 and then removing a window of dura overlying it here
 with suction and curved scissors to the left.
 Once that's removed, you're beginning to see
 that cystic portion of the tumor kind of come out
 towards you and the arachnoid being pushed out here.
 The arachnoid at this juncture is still intact,
 which is why you don't see a CSF leak yet, but subsequently, we'll work through that arachnoid layer
 into the mass.
 Here we are incising and dissecting that arachnoid layer away,
 and you're beginning to see that craniopharyngioma
 just below us here.
 Once we dissect that anterior portion away,
 we'll go ahead and remove that for a frozen section biopsy
 to confirm pathologic diagnosis,
 and then we'll expand our window
 and continue to work into this space.
 As you can tell on imaging,
 this was an adamantomatous craniopharyngioma.

 Papillaries are interesting
 because they do have a BRAF mutation,
 which allows a targeted mutation,
 which these ones of course do not.
 Here's a large portion of the tumor being removed.
 You can see the calcified portion of it
 as well as its cystic component
 coming out through that window.
 Again,"

 the calcified portion of it as well as its cystic component coming out through that window. Again,
 the pituitary stalk is pushed to the left in this case. So we're preserving that and working between
 the optic chiasm, the pituitary stalk, and the cella. Here we are now visualizing into the third
 ventricle to get a little bit of that tumor left there on the patient left side. And here visualizing
 the choroid plexus as well as the bilateral foramen of Monroe. Once that last bit of tumor
 has been resected and the cavity has been inspected, we'll proceed with hemostasis and then
 reconstruction. Here is a duragin graft being placed as an inlay with a piece of gel foam in the middle.

 This is really important in order to remove
 the dead space of the clival recess
 and to extend the length of our flap
 so the length of it is not wasted
 filling the clival recess.

 In summary, craniopharyngiomas are relatively rare supercellar tumors, but the endoscopic
 endonasal approach is an ideal approach for the majority of these tumors.
 The optic nerve and chiasm is at risk during operation, and meticulous microsurgical technique
 around these areas is a good idea."

EccFvrF1_pE,1,"through the nicely exposed translucent dura, but not the tumor, which is covered by the nerve roots.
 Intraoperative ultrasound is a helpful adjunct for localizing the exact position of the tumor.
 It was used to examine the adequacy of the dural exposure before the dura was opened.
 The dura was opened sharply at the midline.
 Effort is made to preserve the arachnoid.
 However, as you can see, not entirely successful every time.
 This is to prevent bulging of the nerve roots into the surgical field.
 Retraction TACOP sutures were used to mobilize the dura laterally, thus increasing the surgical exposure and
 reducing the possibility of epidural venous hemorrhage.
 You can see that the bundle of roots of the lumbar and sacral spinal nerves, otherwise known as cauda equina,
 were under considerable pressure by the tumor.
 They are completely covering the tumor capsule.
 Extramedullary tumors located around the cauda equina can pose a significant surgical challenge due to their often adherence and at times
 engulfing the nerve roots.
 Overlying arachnoid band is
 incised and opened carefully and nerve roots were carefully dissected and mobilized away from the posterior capsule of the tumor.
 Intraoperative neurophysiological parameters such as motor evoked potential,
 somatosensory evoked potentials, and free-running EMG of the major sensory and motor pathways are
 carefully monitored during this step.
 It is noteworthy that this tumor most likely represents a schwannoma,
 which almost exclusively arise from the dorsal or sensory nerve rootlets.
 We will have a brief review at the end of this presentation,
 but here's a quick review of the anatomy and the pattern of the growth of schwannoma.
 As mentioned, they typically arise from the dorsal or sensory nerve rootlets and gradually grow."
EccFvrF1_pE,2,"With careful dissection, we may be able to preserve both motor and sensory function of
 this patient, as the tumor typically arises from a single rootlet, and that rootlet may
 be non-functional, or there may be overlapping or redundant function in the other rootlets,
 which we need to preserve.
 Exposed dorsal pole of the tumor is carefully isolated from the adjacent nerve roots by
 cotinoid patties to prevent heat transfer by low-current bipolar.
 Low-current bipolar cautery was used to devascularize a safe portion of the tumor, which was then
 opened sharply.
 Ultrasonic aspirator was used to carefully emulsify and remove the central content of
 the tumor, thereby reducing its volume and make the exposure easier.

 This procedure is performed by members of our rhinology and general otolaryngology divisions
 for those patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, with or without polyps.
 This video was edited by Zachary Schwamm.
 We begin with an initial endoscopic view of the right nasal cavity.
 On the lateral wall of the nasal cavity are the inferior and middle turbinates.
 The septum is medial. The uncinate process is just lateral to the middle turbinate.
 The first step is a complete uncinectomy.
 Using a maxillary seeker, the uncinate is reflected towards the surgeon along its length.
 A backbiter is then placed in the maxillary os at the inferior aspect of the uncinate
 and is used to resect the inferior aspect."
48LD2S6T0uI,1,"inferior aspect of the uncinet and is used to resect the inferior aspect. A kerosene
 is then used to take the uncinet flush to the lateral wall and then trace it superiorly."
48LD2S6T0uI,2,"and then trace it superiorly.
 A microdebrider is used to dispose of the debris.
 Some of the softer parts of the unsinit are then microdebrided.
 The maxillary sinus comes into view.
 A backbiter is used to further remove a bit of the unsinit."
48LD2S6T0uI,3,"A back biter is used to further remove a bit of the uncinate remnant.
 A pledget with concentrated epinephrine is placed in the middle meatus to provide hemostasis.
 Next, the lateral wall of the maxillary sinus is reflected with a maxillary probe.
 This will give the surgeon the angle to resect this component with a down biter, and then to breeder.
 Now that the uncinate has been removed and the maxillary sinus partially opened, we have a new view with a 0 degree scope.
 The maxillary sinus is around the corner laterally, while we are looking straight at the anterior ethmoid cells known as the ethmoid bulla.
 This is a closer view of the same picture where we can see better laterally.
 A curette is placed in the cleavage plane between the ethmoid bulla and the middle turbinate to perform an anterior ethmoidectomy.
 The basal lamella, which is the horizontal attachment of the middle turbinate, can clearly be seen.
 It is the dividing line between anterior and posterior ethmoid air cells."

 microdibreted away."
48LD2S6T0uI,5,"to dissect out the anterior ethmoid air cells.
 They are then micro-debrided away.
 After dissection, one can see the lamina papretia laterally,
 which is the medial wall of the orbit,
 and the skull base superiorly.
 The color of these two structures is usually similar.
 It is important not to violate either structure,
 as they are the borders of your dissection."
48LD2S6T0uI,6,"which is the medial wall of the orbit and the skull base superiorly. The color of these
 two structures is usually similar. It is important not to violate either structure as they are
 the borders of your dissection. A kerosene is then used to take the lateral wall down
 a bit more such that it is more flush with the lamina."
48LD2S6T0uI,7,"Now, using a 70 degree scope, the maxillary
 anterostomy is finished. The last bit of the lateral wall is removed, ensuring that the
 true maxillary os is revealed. The true maxillary os is in the anterior superior aspect of the
 anterostomy. One can go as far as up to the nasolacrimal duct anteriorly."
48LD2S6T0uI,8,"Anterior maxillary os is in the anterior superior aspect of the anterostomy.
 One can go as far as up to the nasal lacrimal duct anteriorly.
 Still looking up with a 70 degree scope, one can see the skull base posteriorly, the septum
 and middle turbinate medially, and the lateral nasal sidewall and lamina laterally.
 The unopened frontal sinus is marked by the circle and is blocked by an anterior ethmoid
 air cell.
 We will dissect in between this air cell and the middle turbinate to expose it."

 instrument and then a microdebrider. A frontal curette is used to break some of the last
 partitions."
48LD2S6T0uI,10,"one can see the frontal sinusotomy. This is sequentially widened with a frontal kerosene
 known as a cobra as well as a mushroom punch. The white line shows the current outline of
 the frontal sinusotomy and the mucosa overlying the posterior table. After expanding the sinusotomy
 a bit more, the roof of the frontal and the posterior table can be better seen."

bGoLdCbvyqM,6,"like this. Inside of this depression area you can see the irregular microvascular and
 the surface pattern here. Yes? May I ask you a question? This lesion"
bGoLdCbvyqM,7,"the toughest pattern here.
 Yes?
 May I ask you a question?
 This lesion was found on the PET scanner,
 which is not usual because there is a..."
bGoLdCbvyqM,8,"uh uh on the tap on the pet scanner which is not uh
 usual because the the there is a fixation of the of the gastric wall do you think that
 this small lesion it's uh responsible of this fixation or there is a probably a"
bGoLdCbvyqM,9,"of the gastric wall.
 Do you think that this small lesion,
 it's responsible of this fixation
 or there is probably a huge more infiltration
 of the gastric wall?
 Yeah, the question is whether this lesion
 is accountable for the change in the PET scan, right?"
bGoLdCbvyqM,10,"gastric wall yeah the question is uh whether this lesion is accountable for the change in the past
 scan right so yeah the pescan shows some positive uh signal over the uh angiopaloric region
 but i guess that may be related more to the uh previous uh alteration"
bGoLdCbvyqM,11,"signal over the angiopaloric region.
 But I guess that may be related more to the previous ulceration and the inflammatory change.
 Because if you look at this lesion, this is a relatively not big lesion.
 And usually if it's early gastric cancer, we don't see any signal on the PET scan."
bGoLdCbvyqM,12,"lesion this is a relatively not big lesion and usually if it's an early
 gastric cancer we don't see any signal on the PET scan so I guess the PET scan
 signal may not be truly reflected by this lesion but that may be only
 inflammatory change. My question is do you need the EUS to exclude the
 lignitis, a kind of gastric lignitis?
 Do you need EUS?
 I think this lesion is the tiniest lesion and so EUS is not necessary and so very difficult to show the good EUS view
 because the pyrotic link, very close to the pyrotic link is very difficult to assess.
 And so
 but this lesion has not a proteolytic component in the depressed area and I
 think this lesion is an intramucosal cancer.
 Yeah, yeah, I agree. It's probably an intramucosal cancer because irregular micro..."
bGoLdCbvyqM,13,"I think this region is intramucosal cancer, I think.
 Yeah, yeah.
 I agree.
 It's probably an intramucosal cancer because irregular microsurface and microvascular pattern,
 but we can still recognize the pattern.
 So from the VAS classification, this would be just intramucosal early gastric cancer.
 Okay.
 Can I start the EFT procedure?
 Yeah, please.
 Okay.
 Yes."
bGoLdCbvyqM,14,"just intramucosal early gastric cancer.
 Okay, can I start the EFT procedure?
 Yeah, please.
 Okay, I start the marking using dual knife.
 So today, Dr. Ikihara is using a 290 Olympus scope
 with the zoom function.
 And he's now marking around the lesion with the dual knife.
 And I think you are using the NBI,"
bGoLdCbvyqM,15,"Olimpiscope 290 dengan fungsi zoom dan dia sekarang menandakan sekeliling lesion dengan
 kuncinya dan saya rasa anda menggunakan NBI untuk melihat margin lesion.
 Saya rasa ini adalah titik yang sangat penting bahawa kita perlu memastikan margin reseksi yang baik."
bGoLdCbvyqM,16,"at the margin of the lesion.
 I think this is a very important point
 that we have to ensure a good resection margin.
 And now the knife is not out, right?
 You want to just withdraw the knife.
 Not out.
 Not out, yeah.
 So this is another trick.
 So when we are marking, we don't need the knife to be out."
bGoLdCbvyqM,17,"Ya, jadi ini adalah trik lain. Jadi ketika kita menandakan, kita tidak perlukan kunci untuk keluar."
bGoLdCbvyqM,18,"ESDs, but do you think that EMR will work just as well,
 being so small, the lesion?
 Will EMR work?
 I will do the ESD.
 Yeah, I think it is marginal
 for this lesion because"
bGoLdCbvyqM,19,"do the ESD yeah I think it is marginal for this lesion because so when you look at the
 lesion in maybe in one scope you can just include the lesion but it doesn't actually
 include the whole circumferential margin so in one scope if you measure that will be around 10"
bGoLdCbvyqM,20,"In one scope, you can just include the lesion,
 but it doesn't actually include
 the whole circumferential margin.
 So in one scope, if you measure,
 that will be around 10 to 11 mm,
 but that means it's probably 15 to 20 mm in this case.
 So one EMR may not..."
bGoLdCbvyqM,21,"mm but that means it's probably 15 to 20 mm in this case so one year mom may not
 well it may or may not be able to completely reset next I will do the
 injection and initially I start them cause are cutting pyrotic side because
 pyrotic side is this area is very difficult to do sub-mucosal dissection
 and initially I cut this this side and do my adieu
 sub-mucosal dissection please open okay"
bGoLdCbvyqM,22,"So the solution that Dr. Ikihara is using is a mixture of normal saline, indigo carmine
 and epinephrine and in a mixture with sodium hyaluronate."
bGoLdCbvyqM,23,"Dr. Ikihara is using is a mixture of normal saline,
 indigo carmine, and epinephrine,
 and in a mixture with a sodium hyaluronate.
 Okay."
bGoLdCbvyqM,24,"So, this lesion previously presented also with some erosion, so there may be some fibrosis, I don't know, in this case.
 Maybe, maybe.
 Yeah, there are multiple erosions too around the lesion, and that may make it a little bit more difficult.
 Okay, okay.
 Okay, just use a knife, please.
 Use a knife?
 Yes, use a knife.
 And change the coagulation setting to the fifth mode.
 So, the initial diaphragm setting, we are now using the VIO300D diaphragm, and it's an endocut Q mode, effect 2, 2, and duration 2, interval 2.
 And also, when Dr. Ikihara is marking, he is using the force coagulation mode.
 And now...
 Now, he changed to shift coagulation mode for the cutting."
bGoLdCbvyqM,25,"So I think it's a very good strategy to start the cutting from the anal side
 because this is more difficult to cut at the papilloric region.
 And also the gravity is over the fundus,
 so when you proceed, the gravity may help to reject the mucosa
 and help to expose some mucosa.
 Injection, please.
 The central part of the lesion is not very well lifted after the injection.
 Do you think that this is due to the biopsy or to the presence of inflammation and fibrosis?
 There's some part which is not well lifted after injection.
 Do you think it's related to the biopsy?
 Just here, yes.
 This part.
 This part.
 This part.
 Yeah.
 Some..."
bGoLdCbvyqM,26,"just here yes where this part this part yeah some different is not so good maybe
 some some cause of fibrosis exists this area yeah maybe but but it may not be related to
 the cancer maybe may be related I think this is not our not our solution maybe"
bGoLdCbvyqM,27,"I think this is not ulceration, maybe erosion or something."
bGoLdCbvyqM,28,"cut the distal
 side of the mucosa
 and the additional
 submucosa cutting and
 now you can see the blue layer
 it's a
 I injected the
 saline with in your caromide
 and so you can see the blue layer
 like this and
 here is a
 muscular layer
 muscle layer"
bGoLdCbvyqM,29,"and so you can see the blue layer like this and here is a muscular layer.
 Yes.
 Muscle layer.
 I am doing submucosal layer detection using an IT knife and this IT knife has a small
 knife, a small triangle knife and so I can use this short blade.
 Short blade for the lateral cutting.
 Yes, lateral cutting.
 It's an advantage of IT knife too."
bGoLdCbvyqM,30,"For the lateral cutting?
 Yes, lateral cutting.
 It's an advantage of ITNF2.
 So as we have just discussed,
 sometimes the mucosa has some fibrosis
 and may not be related to the cancer,
 but previous erosions and also..."
bGoLdCbvyqM,31,"Sometimes the mucosa has some fibrosis and may not be related to the cancer,
 but previous erosions and also high incidence of H. pylori and gastritis will also affect the ESD in the stomach."
bGoLdCbvyqM,32,"to protect the ESD in the stomach.
 So there are some thick submucosal vessels.
 Dr. EKR, is it okay to use the instrument just to coagulate?
 Dr. Yes, I try to coagulate before cutting."
bGoLdCbvyqM,33,"Dr. EKR, is it okay to use the instrument just to coagulate?
 Yes, I try to coagulate before cutting.
 I changed the device and now I'm using the LV-300 and now soft coagulation mode of FX6 and 80 watt.

 too big why not to use the the the hybrid the technique to snare this uh uh this uh polyp that
 you create now uh because of course the snaring technique is uh one of the choice and the very
 uh this region may have the fibrosis and the submucosal layer the possibility and so
 finally i decided the the esd is a sometimes sneering technique
 failed the one m block resurrection one piece rejection and so initially
 uh finally i choose the dental frost method yes i think we have some
 some
 discussion and uh also uh sometimes i also worry there's some submucosal fibrosis so
 i guess uh using the dental floss with a rejection you can see much better
 yes so how do we tie the dental floss to the clip
 this enough okay you have the external wheel okay please tie okay so just
 tie it like that okay do you want the surgical knot surgical knot yes okay okay okay two times is
 enough okay two times so uh it happens i'm a surgeon so i can do it do you have a scissor
 you"

 of gastric body, close to the gastric cardia.

 proximal edge of the lesion with a hemoclip. Then, the other suture ring is
 fixed along the opposite wall with a hemoclip to apply counter-traction. The
 counter-traction provides direct visualization of the submucosal
 dissection plane, despite a very limited space between the lesion and the muscle
